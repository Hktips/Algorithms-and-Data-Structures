### <ol>Problem Statement: <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/submissions/1438926506">**Given two arrays representing childrenâ€™s green factor and cookie sizes, the goal is to maximise the number of content children.**</a></ol>
```c++
Each child i has a greed factor of g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that will make the child content. Each cookie j has a size of s[j]. If s[j] >= g[j], we can assign cookie j to child i, making the child content. Each child can only receive one cookie.
```
### <ol>Problem Statement: <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/submissions/1439944608">** Given an array representing a queue of customers and the value of bills they hold, determine if it is possible to provide correct change to each customer. Customers can only pay with 5$, 10$ or 20$ bills and we initially do not have any change at hand. Return true, if it is possible to provide correct change for each customer otherwise return false.**</a></ol>
```c++
Example 1:

Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]
Output: true
Explanation: 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
Example 2:

Input: bills = [5,5,10,10,20]
Output: false
Explanation: 
From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
For the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
Since not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false.
 
```

### <ol>Problem Statement: Shortest Job first- **</a></ol>

```c++
Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
bt = [4,3,7,1,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: After sorting burst times by shortest job policy, calculated average waiting time is 4.
 
```
// User function Template for C++

// Back-end compolete function Template for C++

class Solution {
  public:
    long long solve(vector<int>& bt) {
        sort(bt.begin(),bt.end());
        float wait_time=0;
        int total_time=0;
        int n=bt.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            wait_time+=total_time;
            total_time+=bt[i];
        }
        return wait_time/n;
    }
};
